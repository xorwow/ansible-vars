module: vault
short_description: Get or set a value in an Ansible vault or vars file.
version_added: "2.19.2"
requirements:
  - ansible-vars
author:
  - Atlas (@xorwow)
description:
  - Reads or updates values in an encrypted or plain vault or vars file.
  - When C(value) is provided, the module runs in SET mode and writes to the vault.
  - When C(value) is omitted, the module runs in GET mode and returns the decrypted value.
  - Designed for local vault and vars files, does not work on remote machines.
options:
  # Common options
  file:
    description:
      - Path to the local vault file to read or modify.
      - Interpreted relative to the C(playbook_dir) if not absolute.
    required: true
    type: path
  path:
    description:
      - Path to the value within the vault data structure, as a list of int or str keys.
      - Supports the special key C(+) when in SET mode to add an element to a list.
    required: true
    type: list
    elements: raw
  create_file:
    description:
      - Whether to create the file if it does not exist.
      - When enabled, creates a plain/hybrid file as needed (beware that it won't be fully encrypted!).
    type: bool
    default: false
  passphrase:
    description:
      - Passphrase to use for encryption and to try along all other detected keys for decryption.
      - Defaults to the first auto-detected vault key if not provided.
      - Auto-detection tries to infer keys from your C(ansible.cfg).
      - Also used for the C(log_changes) option.
    required: false
    type: str
  # GET options
  default:
    description:
      - Default value to return when the vault path does not exist (GET mode only).
      - If omitted, the task fails on an unknown path.
    required: false
  # SET options
  value:
    description:
      - Value to create or update at the specified path (SET mode only).
      - When present, triggers write/update behavior. If omitted, GET mode is used.
    required: false
  encrypt:
    description:
      - Whether to encrypt the value (or its leaf nodes in case of a non-scalar) (SET mode only).
      - Ansible only supports encrypting string values. Objects are traversed and string leaves encrypted. Numbers are left plain.
    type: bool
    default: true
  create_path:
    description:
      - Whether to create missing path segments as dictionaries (SET mode only).
      - The leaf segment of the path will always be created and set to C(value) if it does not exist.
    type: bool
    default: false
  log_changes:
    description:
      - Optional path to a log file or directory where changes will be recorded as encrypted YAML (SET mode only).
      - Mixing encryption keys / passphrases within a log is not supported.
      - When a directory is given, a file will be created based on the used encryption key to ensure key-unique logs.
      - For auto-detected keys, file names will be based on the vault ID associated with them.
      - For an explicit C(passphrase), the file name is based on the first 8 chars of the secret's SHA-1 hash.
      - Plain logging is not supported, an encryption key must be present either from auto-detection or C(passphrase).
    required: false
    type: path

notes:
  - Beware that running this action in diff mode may leak secrets to your terminal and attached callback plugins.
  - This is only a module stub, used for documentation. Only the associated C(vault) action plugin is executable.
  - Setting values might impact comments and Jinja2 blocks around the affected area of the vault. See C(ansible-vars) documentation.
  - This plugin does not work well for concurrently modifying the same vault. Use C(serial: 1) or C(throttle: 1) where applicable.
